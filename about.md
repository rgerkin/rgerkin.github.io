I'm Richard C. (Rick) Gerkin, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and scientific software developer at Arizona State University.  
My interests are:  
- Neuroinformatics and how to make good use of neurophysiology data.   
- Reproducible, extensible neurophysiology models.  
- Olfactory physiology and psychophysics.  

### Software projects I manage:

- [Recording Artist](https://bitbucket.org/rgerkin/recording-artist), an acquisition and analysis suite for use with [Igor Pro](http://www.wavemetrics.com/products/igorpro/igorpro.htm).
- [SciUnit](https://github.com/scidash/sciunit), a software infrastructure for data-driven validation of scientific models.  
- [NeuronUnit](https://github.com/scidash/neuronunit), a SciUnit library for testing neurophysiology models against experimental data.
